How to parse the cloudwatch event with lambda
https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/change-sns-email-for-cloudwatch-events/

Both cloudwatch and SNS are region specific

You cannot unsubscribe to a subscription that is pending confirmation.
If you use email, email-json, or http/https (without auto-confirmation enabled), until the subscription is confirmed (e.g., outside of Terraform), AWS does not allow Terraform to delete / unsubscribe the subscription.
If you destroy an unconfirmed subscription, Terraform will remove the subscription from its state but the subscription will still exist in AWS.
However, if you delete an SNS topic, SNS deletes all the subscriptions associated with the topic. Also, you can import a subscription after confirmation and then have the capability to delete it.

Does not work with aws_sns_topic_subscription but might be worth looking into.
